# Data-Analysis-Excel-Projects

While learning Advanced Excel for Data Analytics, I have prepared dashboards to have a hands-on practice on all Excel Functions. 
These dashboards (and the attached Excel workings) show how I have cleaned the raw data, formatted the cleaned data and finally created pivots and charts to visualize the findings.


## **DASHBOARD 1 -**

**_Bank Loan Report : SUMMARY DASHBOARD_**

This dashboard displays information regarding the following Key Performance Indicators :
  1. Total Loan Applications
  2. Total Funded Amount
  3. Total Amount Received by Bank
  4. Average Interest Rate
  5. Average DTI (Debt to Interest) Ratio

The Pie Charts represent the percentage of Good Loans and Bad Loans issued and the associated KPIs.   

Good Loand and Bad Loans have been identified based on the IF formula taking Loan Status as the base.
